The Visual Studio C Compiler does not support C99 standard! So, to compile this project use the Visual Studio C++ Compiler. 
To do this, rename all .c files to .cpp . You can use the "c2cpp.bat" and "cpp2c.bat" to do this.

Libarys:
- SLD-Lib (1.x) : http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php
- SDL_Mixer-Lib (2.x) : http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/


To run you need
 - SDL.dll
 - SDL_mixer.dll
 - SPA?.PA
 - missions.xml
 - lng_de.xml
files in your "debug" / "release" folder.
