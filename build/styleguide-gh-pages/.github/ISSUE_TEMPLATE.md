This repository publishes copies of Google's internal style guides to
assist developers working on Google owned and originated open source
projects. Development on these guides does not take place here.

Substantive changes to the style rules and suggested new rules should
not be submitted as issues in this repository. Material changes must be
proposed, discussed, and approved on the internal forums first.

If an issue points out a simple mistake — a typo, a broken link, etc. —
then a correction might be made. However there is no commitment to do
so. Issues are normally closed without comment.
