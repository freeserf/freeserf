//
// return the MapPos of the Flag* of the Inventory (castle, stock/warehouse) that is the shortest
//  number of Flags away from the MapPos of the requested Flag or Building
//
//  this function accepts EITHER a Flag pos, OR a Building pos (for which it will check the flag)
//
//  - the Inventory must be accepting Resources
//  - no consideration for if the Inventory is accepting Serfs
//  - no consideration of tile/straightline distance, only Flag distance matters
//  - no check to see if transporters/sailors are already in place along the path
//
// the intention of this function is to help "pair" most buildings in the AI player's realm to a
// given Inventory so that each Inventory can have accurate counts and limits of the buildings
// "paired" with that Inventory. The reason that straightline distance cannot be used (as it 
//  originally was) is that only Flag distance determines which Inventory a resource-producing
//  -building will send non-directly-routable resources to (i.e. ones piling up in storage)
//  If straightline-dist is used when determining nearest Inventory, but flag distance is used when
//   serfs transport resources to Inventories, the Inventory that receives the resouce may not be 
//   the Inventory "paired" with the building, and so the "stop XXX when resource limit reached"
//   checks would never be triggered because the check is running against one Inventory while
//   some other Inventory is actually piling up resources and may have already passed its limit.

//  the AI does not currently change these stock accept/reject/purge resource/serf settings so
